    <h1 id="the-world-wide-web">The World Wide Web</h1>
    <p role="doc-subtitle">The <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> is one of the best inventions humanity has ever seen. It is true that every invention has its disadvantages and negative effects, but it is without no doubt that the Web has united the world now more than ever, and
        is responsible for the lightning-fast transmission of information.</p>

    <h2 id="the-birth-of-the-web">The Birth of the Web</h2>
    <p>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is home to one of the most famous and most important experiments ever: the Large Hadron Collider. This experiment needs communication with scientists from all over the world, and such communication
        used to be a real challenge for them when the world used to lack a way of fast transfer of information.</p>

    <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee saw this problem. He is a computer scientist and physicist at CERN in the 1980s. At the beginning of the decade, he started a project to solve CERN’s problem regarding the transfer of information. After more or less than 10
        years, he wrote a document entitled <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html"><cite>Information Management: A Proposal</cite></a>. In this document, he explained how his solution
        could help with how data is shared between computers, regardless of which company manufactured the computer, or where in the world that computer is being used. This proposal became what we now know as the World Wide Web.</p>

    <h2 id="the-internet">The Internet</h2>
    <p>When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, the Internet already exists. It is already being used at CERN, as well as other institutions and universities. The Internet is a network of networks. A computer is connected to other computers
        within an establishment or a specific location, and its server, the central computer of the network, is connected to other servers from the rest of the world.</p>

    <p>Each computer is connected to other computers using telephone wires. Making use of an existing technology at the time instead of building a new one from scratch meant that they could start using it faster. This establishes a very important principle
        that we will see over and over again: <b>new technology is only possible because an old one already exists</b>.</p>

    <p>Take for example the telegraph. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, we put cables under the sea to connect telegraphs to one another. Several decades later, those same cables were repurposed to carry telephone signals instead. When the Internet was
        put into wide use, those cables were used again to now instead transmit digital signals for the Internet. And in our time, those cables are now made up of optical fibers that transmit digital signals using light.</p>

    <p>The Internet has no center. This makes it very strong and durable. When the initial research for what would become the Internet, it was made for the military and was funded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). During that time,
        the Internet was said to be so durable, it could survive a nuclear attack. That, however, is not true. The engineers who worked on the project were not military personnel. They however fortified the Internet to survive certain damages: the
        Internet can survive censorship and attacks to freedom of speech.</p>

    <h3 id="characteristics-of-the-internet">Characteristics of the Internet</h3>
    <h4 id="decentralized">Decentralized</h4>
    <p>The Internet has no central computer that controls every other computer that connects to it. In a centralized network, the whole network is disrupted when the central computer, or server, is damaged. Because the Internet is decentralized, not
        everyone is affected when a server gets damaged.</p>

    <h4 id="dumb">Dumb</h4>
    <p>The protocols or rules that apply for the transmission of data over the Internet only describe how packets of data will be sent from computer to computer. They do not care about the contents of those data packets. This makes it possible for the
        Internet to be capable of transmitting all sorts of applications: email, Telnet, FTP, and now, the World Wide Web.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-internet-and-the-world-wide-web">What is the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web?</h2>
    <p>In short, the World Wide Web is the content you get online. The Internet is what gets that content from different servers and give it to you.</p>

    <h3 id="internet">Internet</h3>
    <p>The Internet is a network of networks. Your computer connects to a network set up for you by your Internet service provider (ISP). Your ISP then connects that network to other networks all over the world so you can access their data.</p>

    <p>World Wide Web The World Wide Web is an application of the Internet. This means that it is a technology that uses the Internet. Email is another application of the Internet<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The World
        Wide Web is the content that you get online.</p>

    <h2 id="how-the-web-works">How the Web works</h2>
    <p>Humans speak human languages. We have millions of words, and many of these words change their meaning or evoke a different emotion or connotations depending on the context, environment, the listener’s background, or the way it was spoken. Human
        languages are so complicated, it can only be learned through years of practice and use.</p>

    <p>Computers also speak languages. <dfn>Programming languages</dfn> are different from our languages. They are more logical and consistent. They have exact grammar rules and semantics, it is almost as if computers are doing math instead of speaking
        a language.
        <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> It doesn’t matter what the context is or how something is said or what tone is used to communicate—words in a programming language do not change meaning.</p>

    <p>The Internet is a place where human languages and programming languages meet. Online content are used not just by humans but also other computers. Artificial intelligence, for example, is a branch of Computer Science that aims to teach computers
        how to understand what humans are doing. What if we have a way to tell computers exactly what we mean when we say something or why we do things? That is the purpose of a programming language called HTML.</p>

    <h3 id="the-main-components-of-the-web">The main components of the Web</h3>
    <p>The Web is made up of three different programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <h4 id="html">HTML</h4>
    <p>HyperText Markup Language is a language that “marks up” the content of a Web page. Basically, it tells the browser what each part of the Web page means and what purpose it serves. HTML also gives us the ability to use functionality that the browser
        includes by default. We can use those features on our Web pages by using certain HTML.</p>

    <h4 id="css">CSS</h4>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets give us the ability to include visual styling and layout on our Web pages. With CSS, we can change a Web page’s design, including colors, typography, and sizes. We can also include interactions and animations using CSS.</p>

    <h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that we use to add features that the browser does not have by default. We don’t need to use JavaScript and we can build Web sites without it. However, as a user interface gets more complex, the more likely
        it is to need JavaScript.</p>

    <p>If you have prior knowledge of other programming languages before this class, this might confuse you. You might say, <q>why do we need three programming languages? Why can’t we just use one?</q> Well, the Web platform is different from other types
        of software. You can design Web sites today and trust that it will work even five or ten years in the future without giving it updates. You can also create Web pages so that it would still work on old computers and browsers that were made
        ten years ago. Web sites are viewed by people on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, smart watches, home appliances, televisions, e-book readers, and even devices that you didn’t even know exists! The range of devices that use HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript in some form or another is huge. That is what the World Wide Web is invented for: to provide a way for people to share data and information regardless of what devices we are using. Isn’t that cool? Such a feat is only possible
        because we are using three different programming languages on the Web, each doing a part of the job.</p>

    <p>Because we are using three different programming languages, we have the ability as developers to combine and mix these together and simultaneously give our Web sites both resilience (durability) and powerful features. In this class, and in the
        future classes you will take about CSS and JavaScript, you must always remember: prioritize the resilience and durability before anything else. Ensure that your Web site runs on the widest range of devices as much as possible. And then add
        features. If you can use HTML to provide a feature or functionality, use it. If not, only then should you use CSS and HTML.</p>

    <p>HTML is often taken for granted. Most people who study Web development only gloss over on HTML and then move on to more hard topics. But as you will learn throughout this class, the time you will use to study the ins and outs of HTML is worth
        it so you can utilize it to its full potential.</p>

          <p>Although emails can be read through email clients on the Web, like Gmail, Proton Mail, and others, these clients are only a bridge between the Web and the technology that makes emails work. Emails still use a different technology behind
                the scenes, and is not a part of the World Wide Web. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

          <p>Technically, computer languages are actually mathematical operations. Computers use binary numbers to speak to each other, store and retrieve data, and operate. Everything that a computer needs to work on is converted into numbers—applications,
                documents, images, videos, music files—all of these are converted into numbers before the computer could do anything with them. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
